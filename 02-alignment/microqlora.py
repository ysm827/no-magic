"""
How to fine-tune a 4-bit quantized model with full-precision LoRA adapters — the technique
that brought LLM fine-tuning to consumer GPUs.
"""
# Reference: Dettmers et al., "QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized Language Models"
# (2023). https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314
# Combines microquant.py's quantization with microlora.py's low-rank adaptation.
# Architecture: microgpt pattern (Radford et al., 2019) with pedagogical simplifications.

# === TRADEOFFS ===
# + Enables fine-tuning of large models on consumer GPUs (4-bit base + FP adapters)
# + NF4 quantization is information-theoretically optimal for normal distributions
# + Combines memory savings of quantization with parameter efficiency of LoRA
# - Double quantization adds dequantization overhead at every forward pass
# - Quantization error accumulates through layers (deeper models are more affected)
# - Training is slower than standard LoRA due to repeated dequantization
# WHEN TO USE: Fine-tuning models that exceed available GPU memory at full
#   precision. Enables 65B+ parameter fine-tuning on a single 48GB GPU.
# WHEN NOT TO: When full-precision LoRA fits in memory (unnecessary accuracy loss),
#   or when training speed is more important than memory savings.

# adapters (full-precision Value objects) while base weights are quantized integers
# with no autograd. The dequantize operation creates Value objects from quantized data,
# allowing gradients to flow through the LoRA path but NOT through the base weights.

  ───────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────────────
  Pretrain (FP32)        | {pretrain_time:>6.1f}s   | {BASE_STEPS} steps, all {len(param_list):,} params
  Quantize (FP32→NF4)   | <0.1s     | {total_weights} weights, RMSE={rmse:.6f}
  QLoRA fine-tune        | {qlora_time:>6.1f}s   | {QLORA_STEPS} steps, {len(lora_param_list)} LoRA params only
  Total                  | {total_time:>6.1f}s   |

  What QLoRA achieves:
    1. Base weights compressed to 4-bit ({fp32_bytes} → {nf4_bytes + dq_scale_bytes:.0f} bytes)
    2. Fine-tuning trains only {len(lora_param_list)} params ({len(lora_param_list) / max(total_weights, 1):.1%} of base)
    3. Full-precision computation preserved (dequantize during forward)
    4. Gradients flow through LoRA adapters only (base stays frozen)

  Cross-reference:
    - microlora.py:  FP32 base + LoRA adapters (no quantization)
    - microquant.py: Quantized model, no fine-tuning (post-training only)
    - microqlora.py: Quantized base + LoRA fine-tuning (this script, best of both)
