"""
The autoregressive language model from first principles: GPT learns to predict the next
character in a sequence using nothing but matrix multiplication, attention, and gradient descent.
"""
# Reference: This implementation follows the GPT-2 architecture (Radford et al., 2019)
# with pedagogical simplifications: RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm, ReLU instead of GELU,
# no bias terms. Algorithmic flow inspired by Karpathy's microgpt.py but rewritten from
# scratch with comprehensive commenting for educational clarity.

# === TRADEOFFS ===
# + Captures long-range dependencies via self-attention (O(n^2) but parallelizable)
# + Scales predictably: more data + more params = better performance (scaling laws)
# + Autoregressive generation is simple: just keep predicting the next token
# - O(n^2) memory in sequence length limits context windows
# - Requires massive datasets to generalize; small data leads to memorization
# - No built-in uncertainty: generates confidently even when wrong
# WHEN TO USE: Text generation, code completion, any sequential prediction task
#   where you have sufficient training data and compute.
# WHEN NOT TO: Real-time streaming with strict latency constraints, or tasks
#   where bidirectional context is essential (use BERT-style instead).
