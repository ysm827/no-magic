"""
Before attention conquered everything -- how sequences were modeled with recurrence, and why
gating was the breakthrough that made RNNs actually work.
"""
# Reference: Vanilla RNN dates to the 1980s (Rumelhart et al.). GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
# introduced by Cho et al., "Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
# Statistical Machine Translation" (2014). This implementation demonstrates both side-by-side
# on the same character-level language modeling task to show why gating matters.

# === TRADEOFFS ===
# + Constant memory per step: processes arbitrarily long sequences in O(1) space
# + Gating (GRU/LSTM) solves vanishing gradients for moderate-length dependencies
# + Natural fit for streaming/online data where inputs arrive one at a time
# - Sequential processing prevents parallelization across time steps
# - Practically limited context: gradients still decay over hundreds of steps
# - Outperformed by transformers on most benchmarks when parallel compute is available
# WHEN TO USE: Streaming/real-time sequence tasks, resource-constrained devices,
#   or when sequence lengths are moderate and parallelism is unavailable.
# WHEN NOT TO: Tasks requiring long-range dependencies (>100 steps), or when
#   parallel hardware is available (transformers will be faster and more accurate).
