"""
How retrieval augments generation -- the simplest system that actually works, with BM25

# Reference: RAG architecture inspired by "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for
# Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks" (Lewis et al., 2020), BM25 scoring from Robertson
# and Zaragoza (2009). Implementation rewritten from scratch for educational clarity.

# === TRADEOFFS ===
# + Grounds generation in retrieved evidence, reducing hallucination
# + Knowledge base is updateable without retraining the model
# + Separates knowledge storage from reasoning capability
# - Retrieval quality bottlenecks generation quality (garbage in, garbage out)
# - Increases latency: retrieval step adds overhead before generation
# - Context window limits how much retrieved evidence the model can use
# WHEN TO USE: Question answering over a knowledge base, enterprise search,
#   or any task where factual accuracy and source attribution matter.
# WHEN NOT TO: Creative writing, tasks with no external knowledge source,
#   or when latency budget cannot accommodate a retrieval step.
