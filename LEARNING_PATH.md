# Learning Path

A structured guide through all 41 no-magic implementations. Pick a track based on your interest, check off scripts as you complete them, and build intuition for how modern AI/ML systems work under the hood.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Pick a track** that matches your interest or time budget. Tracks 1-2 are weekend-sized. Tracks 3-5 go deeper on specific topics. Track 6 covers everything.
2. **Check off scripts** as you complete them using the `- [ ]` checkboxes.
3. **Each script runs with zero setup** — just `python <path>`. No virtual environment, no dependencies, no configuration.
4. **Read each script top-to-bottom like a tutorial**, then run it. The comments explain the "why" at every step. After running, experiment: change hyperparameters, swap datasets, break things on purpose.
5. **Prerequisites matter.** Each step lists what it builds on. If you jump into a track mid-way, check the "Builds on" field and backfill gaps.

- **Time:** 40 min
- [ ] Completed

## Track 3: Deep Dive — Modern Inference (~5 hrs)

Making models fast and small. This track covers every major inference optimization: efficient attention patterns, positional encoding, KV caching, memory management, quantization, decoding strategies, and state-space models.

**Prerequisites:** `01-foundations/microgpt.py` (transformer forward pass and attention mechanics).

- **Time:** 40 min
- [ ] Completed

**3. `03-systems/microrope.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How Rotary Position Embeddings encode position by rotating query and key vectors in 2D subspaces, giving the model relative position awareness without learned position embeddings.
- **Builds on:** `microattention` (query/key dot product mechanics).

- **Time:** 35 min
- [ ] Completed

**4. `03-systems/microkv.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How KV caching avoids redundant computation during autoregressive generation by storing previously computed key and value tensors and only computing attention for the new token.

- **Time:** 35 min
- [ ] Completed

**5. `03-systems/micropaged.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How PagedAttention manages KV cache memory using virtual memory concepts — fixed-size blocks, a page table, and on-demand allocation — eliminating memory fragmentation during batched inference.
- **Builds on:** `microkv` (KV cache fundamentals).
- **Key moment:** The page table lookup — instead of contiguous pre-allocated memory, the cache maps logical positions to physical blocks, enabling efficient memory sharing across sequences.
- **Time:** 40 min
- [ ] Completed

**6. `03-systems/microquant.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How post-training quantization maps 32-bit floating point weights to 8-bit or 4-bit integers using scale and zero-point calibration, shrinking model size with minimal accuracy loss.

- **Time:** 35 min
- [ ] Completed

**8. `03-systems/microssm.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How state-space models replace attention with a linear recurrence that processes sequences in O(N) time, achieving transformer-competitive quality without the quadratic attention bottleneck.
- **Builds on:** `microgpt` (sequence modeling baseline for comparison).

## Track 4: Deep Dive — Generative Models (~4 hrs)

How models create new data. This track covers three generative paradigms: variational autoencoders (compress-and-reconstruct), adversarial networks (generator vs discriminator), and diffusion models (iterative denoising). Each takes a fundamentally different approach to the same problem.

**Prerequisites:** Basic autograd understanding from `01-foundations/microgpt.py` (the `Value` class pattern).

### Steps

**1. `01-foundations/microvae.py`**

- **Builds on:** `microgpt` (autograd `Value` class for backpropagation).
- **Key moment:** The reparameterization trick — sampling z = mu + sigma * epsilon makes the random sampling step differentiable, which is the key insight that makes VAE training possible.
- **Time:** 50 min
- [ ] Completed

**2. `01-foundations/microgan.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How Generative Adversarial Networks train two competing networks — a generator that creates fake data and a discriminator that tries to detect fakes — pushing both to improve through adversarial pressure.
- **Builds on:** `microgpt` (autograd, neural network training loops).
- **Key moment:** The training instability — watching the generator and discriminator losses oscillate as each adapts to the other's improvements, and seeing how careful learning rate balancing prevents mode collapse.
- **Time:** 50 min
- [ ] Completed

**3. `01-foundations/microdiffusion.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noising process, generating data by starting from pure noise and iteratively denoising through learned score estimates.
- **Builds on:** `microgpt` (autograd), `microvae` (latent space concepts, helpful but not required).
- **Key moment:** The noise schedule visualization — at each timestep the model predicts and removes a slice of noise, and the generated sample gradually sharpens from static into recognizable structure.
- **Time:** 60 min
- [ ] Completed

## Track 5: Deep Dive — Retrieval & Search (~3 hrs)

Connecting models to external knowledge. This track covers how to represent text as vectors, retrieve relevant documents, and tokenize text for downstream tasks. These are the building blocks of RAG systems and search engines.

**Prerequisites:** None — this track is self-contained.

### Steps

**1. `01-foundations/microembedding.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How Word2Vec's skip-gram model learns vector representations where geometric relationships between vectors encode semantic relationships between words.
- **Builds on:** None — this is the entry point.

- **Time:** 40 min
- [ ] Completed

**2. `01-foundations/microrag.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines a vector similarity search over a document store with a language model, grounding generated responses in retrieved evidence.
- **Builds on:** `microembedding` (vector representations for similarity search).
- **Key moment:** The retrieval step — the model's response quality jumps when it conditions on relevant retrieved passages instead of relying solely on its parameters.
- **Time:** 50 min
- [ ] Completed

**3. `01-foundations/microtokenizer.py`**
- **You'll learn:** How BPE tokenization converts arbitrary text into a fixed vocabulary of subword units, balancing vocabulary size against sequence length.
- **Builds on:** None (placed last in this track as a complementary perspective on text preprocessing after seeing embeddings and retrieval).
- **Key moment:** The merge table — each merge reduces total token count, and the final vocabulary captures morphological structure (prefixes, suffixes, stems) without any linguistic rules.
- **Time:** 30 min
- [ ] Completed
